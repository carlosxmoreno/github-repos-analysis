# github-repos-analysis
Research on estimation methods using gitHub metadata. Related to a Master Thesis
Part of a research project related to the possibility of making a priori estimates of the effort required to develop software projects. This is a problem that has been previously studied by many authors, and there are several estimation models of different nature. However, the approach that combines the analysis of the metadata of thousands of projects hosted in a public repository (GitHub), with the perspective of the methodology of analysis of massive data and unsupervised learning is a different orientation to what has been done to date. In this project, all the methodological steps of data analysis are applied, reaching the definition of a model that opens new possibilities in research related to Software Engineering, project management and related subjects. In turn, the project proposes an architecture, through a proof of concept, to support the analysis process, as well as the potential development of a solution in a production environment. The results obtained will allow the study to evolve in order to provide a competitive advantage to new developers who wish to offer competitive commercial proposals for their projects, but who do not have the resources or sufficient experience to carry out the estimate.

By now, code is not sanitized nor optimized and only with Spanish comments.
